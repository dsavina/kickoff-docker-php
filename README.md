# Goal

This project will help you to setup a PHP project with Docker, thanks to some useful `make` commands.

# Prerequisites

Docker (**>= 1.12**) for MacOS / Linux: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation

Docker Compose (**>= 1.8.0**) for MacOS / Linux: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install

# Quick start

**Important for Linux users:** make sure you're not using `root` user. Your current user must be part of `sudo` and `docker` groups.

First, fork this project and clone it or download the tarball using:

```
curl -L https://github.com/thecodingmachine/kickoff-docker-php/archive/master.tar.gz > kickoff-docker-php.tar.gz
```

You now dispose of a nice docker empty shell, ready to run any classic php/mysql project. Put your sources in `apache/volume` (of course, you can, and you should, make it a git repository, tracking your own project. Parent project ".gitignores" this folder, so who cares?)

Once done, move to the root directory of this project and run:

```
cp .env.template .env
cp apache/php.ini.template php.ini
```

Now open the file located at `/etc/hosts` (on MacOS / Linux) and add the following line at the end of the file:

```
127.0.0.1   dev.yourproject.com
```
 
Good :smiley:? We're now done with the configuration! :metal:

Last but not least, shutdown your local Apache or anything which could use your 80 and 443 ports, and run:

```
make kickoff
```

The installation might take some time, so go for a coffee break! :coffee: 

Once everything has been installed, open your favorite web browser and copy / paste http://dev.yourproject.com and check if everything is OK!

# Dive in

## How does it work?

There are three important files:

* `.env.template` which contains variables with default values.
* `docker-compose.yml.template` which contains the run configuration of the Apache and MySQL containers plus some of the variables defined in `.env.template`.
* `docker-compose-nginx.yml.template` which contains the run configuration of the NGINX container plus some of the variables defined in `.env.template`.

As these files are templates, they are not used directly. That's why you have to:

* run `cp .env.template .env` and update the variables' values in the `.env` file at your convenience.
* run `make kickoff` which runs `make prepare`: this command creates the `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose-nginx.yml` files using the variables' values defined in the `.env` file.

For security concern, these three files have been added in the `.gitignore` file as they contain sensible data like the MySQL database password and so on.

## Project structure

This project will run three containers:

1. A reverse proxy using the well-known [jwilder/nginx-proxy](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy) image.
2. An Apache container with PHP 7.1 (and core PHP libraries), Composer (for managing your PHP dependencies), Node.js and npm (for managing your frontend dependencies).
3. A MySQL container using MySQL 5.7.

<p align="center">
<img src="docs/images/readme1.png" alt="Containers and project structure" />
</p>

* The `apache/volume` folder is where your source code must be located. It is mapped with the `/var/www/html` folder on the Apache container.
* The `mysql/volume` has been created by the MySQL container. It is where your database is persisted on the host.

## Link your PHP application to your MySQL database

It is actually quite simple. In your Apache container, the hostname of the MySQL database is equal to the variable's value `MYSQL_SERVICE_NAME` defined in the `.env` file. Also, just use the port `3306` and the credentials defined in the `.env` file. 

## Manage your database

The simplest way is to access directly to the MySQL cli using `make mysql-cli`.

If you want to manage your database with a more powerful tool (like MySQL Workbench), open your `.env` file in your favorite editor, set the variable `MYSQL_ENABLE_PORTS_MAPPING=1`, update if needed the variable `MYSQL_HOST_PORT_TO_MAP` and finally run `make kickoff`.

You are now able to access on your host to your MySQL database using `127.0.0.1` and the port defined in the variable `MYSQL_HOST_PORT_TO_MAP`. See also: [Use MySQL Workbench to manage your database](docs/mysql_workbench.md)

## Xdebug support

Open your `.env` file in your favorite editor, set the variable `APACHE_ENABLE_XDEBUG=1` and run `make kickoff`. 

It will enable Xdebug on the Apache container. See also: [Use Xdebug with PhpStorm](docs/xdebug.md)

## SSL support

Open your `.env` file in your favorite editor, set the variable `NGINX_ENABLE_SSL=1` and run `make kickoff`. 

It will enable SSL on the NGINX container. Make sure that you have defined the correct path to your certifications in `NGINX_CERTS_PATH`!

You will find more information on how to make SSL work here: https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy#ssl-support

If you're using SSL Certificate Chains, we advise you to read the official NGINX documentation: https://www.nginx.com/resources/admin-guide/nginx-ssl-termination/#cert_chains

## Multiple environments/projects on the same host

As you long as each `NGINX_PROXY_NAME` and `PROXY_NETWORK` variables in your `.env` files have the same values, you are able to run as many environments/projects as you need. 

Make sure that you have defined a different `APACHE_VIRTUAL_HOST` value for each of your Apache containers.

## Install more PHP extensions

Open the `Dockerfile` located in the `apache/volume` folder and [follow the official instructions](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/php#how-to-install-more-php-extensions).

Once done, run `make kickoff` to rebuild your Apache container.

# FAQ / Known issues

**Should I use this in production?**

This project aims to help you starting a PHP development environment on Docker. As the `www-data` user in the Apache container shares the same `uid` as your current user, we do not recommend using this project for your production environment.

**docker-compose failed to parse my yaml file**

Make sure that your file's indents are corrects!

**I've added a make command, but it's not working**

Make sure that your `Makefile` uses tab indents! In PhpStorm, click on `Edit > Convert Indents > To Tabs`.

**My web application is not really fast on MacOS**

Yep, this seems to be a current limitation of Docker on MacOS (see [#8076](https://forums.docker.com/t/file-access-in-mounted-volumes-extremely-slow-cpu-bound/8076)).

**Xdebug is not working on MacOS**

* If you have php-fpm installed on your machine, the port 9000 might already be used. You have to change the `xdebug.remote_port` variable's value with `1000` and updates your IDE configuration for Xdebug.
* Add the `xdebug.idekey` variable with your corresponding value in the `ext-xdebug.ini` file. You might also have to update the `xdebug.remote_host` variable's value with the IP address of your container (`docker inspect YOUR_APACHE_CONTAINER_NAME`).
